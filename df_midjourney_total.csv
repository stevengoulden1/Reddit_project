79,79,Need help with prompts to create this style of background,"Can someone help me with what prompts I might use to create backgrounds similar to these?

Unfortunately, I don't know what this style is called or if it even *has* a name. Is it an art style, like maybe a ""collage""... or is it a technique of some sort? If it *does* have a name, that might help me with the prompts.

I'm trying to produce backgrounds with assorted-sized swirly hearts in various shades of a specific color (I do not want multiple colors in the same background), with soft edges, blended together and randomly positioned on a background of the same color, but in a darker shade.  

These particular backgrounds were created using ""watercolor"" in the prompt, but I've also seen them created using ""oil painting"", ""ink"", ""terracotta"", ""parchment"", ""suede"", ""satin,"" ""glass"", ""bubble"" ""liquid"", ""smoke"", ""monet"", ""impressionist"", etc. I hope to be able to use this variable for different art products, textures, and styles (or even specific artists' styles).

I've tried lots of different prompts, but all of the results suck. Some of the keywords I have used, in every possible combination, include collage, swirls, surreal, psychadelic, liquid, blended, intertwined, interwoven, interlinked, and more. 

One of the prompts I tried was:

>scattered swirly hearts with soft edges, in shades of light blue, watercolor paint style, blended and intertwined together, on a dark blue suede background

Whatever I do, the hearts turn out to be either (a) melded together in a big, indistinguishable lump with no semblance of a heart shape in sight, or (b) completely separate and apart from each other with hard erges, or (c) one big, single heart that's either really cool or really scary.

Thank you!",midjourney,3.0,19bqtj3,t3_19bqtj3,19bqtj3,"ChatGPT described the first image this way: The image appears to be a watercolor painting featuring a repeated pattern of blue heart shapes. The hearts vary in shade, with some being a light sky blue and others a deeper navy, creating a sense of depth and texture. The style is somewhat abstract, with soft edges and a fluidity typical of watercolor techniques, which gives the pattern an organic feel., Thank you, I will try that. However, I have used the keywords ""repeating pattern,"" and I end up with a repeating pattern—not the random placement, colors, and sizes I desire. The hearts end up being all the same size and color in a uniform placement., To get a tiling pattern in MJ, you don't use instructions in the prompt. You use the --tile parameter. [https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/tile-2](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/tile-2) (Which doesn't work well with v6 currently, they're working on it.)

Be wary of raw chatGPT with MJ; it uses a conversational style which is not the ideal prompting style for Midjourney :p Most of the words in there won't be interpreted at all. I'd suggest simplifying by removing everything except the words that refer to things that can be directly visualized."

* Completely dead and joyless expression.

* Lines kind of remind me of puppet strings.

* The mysterious folks behind her look like some kind of corporate oversight controlling her.

* She looks lonely., Maybe it just depends on how she's feeling at the time 🤣, Orange outfit resembles a Buddhist monk

Placid calm expression.

The people behind suggest wings if you squint

The people behind are all looking toward the light, not at us. Holding their hands As if praying.  As if they are connecting to something we can't see.

173,173,Blunt Bob,,midjourney,9.0,19bbao6,t3_19bbao6,19bbao6,"1. Start with a prompt with the focus on producing an interesting concept with interesting colours. Don't worry about how it's framed or how the subject looks.
2. Subtle vary with the subject you're looking for in mind. This subtle vary carries over stylistic and visual aspects of the original image, while incorporating the new words you've added in the second prompt. 
3. Subtle vary again as a finishing touch with whatever you'd like. I added ""Disney Pixar-style animated"" to change her proportions to be more whimsical and less based in reality. The trick here is that you have to strong vary the output you get after subtle varying in order to ""lock in"" all of the changes and elements you've built into the image, and when you strong vary image 3 on slide 2, you get the main image, the finished result.

if you ever want to see more, my instagram is @promptcam 🤠, I want to follow your method, but how do you subtle vary while incorporating new words in the prompt? Do I copy the subtlety varied prompt code, add words, and submit as it own prompt? Or can I access a function that allows me to edit my prompt in a pop up before I submit it for subtle variations?, in /settings, make sure the ""remix mode"" is highlighted green, this way, when you tap on ""vary (subtle)"", it will pull up the prompt before submitting the job, this is where you can edit the prompt of the image that you are seeking to vary, Shit that’s right, thank you very much, no problem!! let me know if you experience similar results, it blew my mind when i found that strong varying a subtle varied image transforms the jumbled mess into a much more cohesive output"

""People were gone. I was just wasting time searching for them. Everywhere I looked, wherever I found myself, only one thing awaited me. Emptiness. This journey on the yacht was superfluous. Beyond the horizon, there was nothing.""

Robert bowed his head to the water's surface and saw a fin.

Several sharks swam peacefully among the rhythmically swaying ships. The absence of people affected the marine inhabitants. They had become bolder and were no longer afraid of the constant clatter of propellers and darting boats.

After a few moments, the water began to sparkle.

Robert was amazed. He peered into the ocean depths with genuine interest, and what he saw took his breath away.

He saw fluorescent inhabitants of the sea depths, ranging from medium-sized fish to colonies of very small jellyfish.

Usually, such creatures were found at great depths, where light gave way to pitch darkness, but now, for some completely unknown reason, all these creatures were here, at his feet.

Thousands, hundreds of thousands of creatures created an entire universe of bright, varied colors.

The hypnotic dance of various forms of bodies, lured the last man.

He wanted to descend to them, and he was not even frightened by the realization that among the stars of the ocean, predatory shadows lurked, occasionally passing close enough to Robert for him to clearly see the sharp teeth and empty, black eyes.

The man stood up.

The sky above the man's head, filled with the light of billions of suns, collided with the ocean horizon, ignited by life itself.

There was truly cosmic silence.

No wind, no waves, no splashes.

The last doubts left Robert, he took a long, decisive step forward, and in the next moment, he was flying into the water, not closing his eyes, towards life.

And you can certainly use it to create logos... although it can be tricky, since MJ really wants to add a lot of delicate detail and you kinda have to fight to get it to stop ;) Still, if you look at the ""explore"" page and search for logo, you'll find some good examples. (Top hint is use ""--style raw"", especially if you're using version 6 of MJ. Helps for v5.2 as well though.)

I'd agree about the text though. Version 6 does it much better than earlier versions but it's still iffy. I would make the images elements in MJ, and then use graphics editing software (like Illustrator) to combine with text and control size and format."

If you were wondering about changing images you've already generated, which is how I read your post title -- you can do that too (now). Turn on ""remix"" in /settings, and then you can set an aspect ratio, or change it. (Earlier versions tended to stretch the image if you did this, but not any more).

[https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/remix](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/remix) 

You can also change the shape of an image by adding more to the top/bottom or sides using the ""pan"" button, for versions lower than 6 (supposedly coming soon to 6 as well).

As for STYLE consistency, the most reliable method I've found is to use the style tuner (not supported in v6 yet but this is also supposedly coming soon). [https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/style-tuner](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/style-tuner), thank you so much! Yeah, I noticed that, def it's more for one off outcome, maybe they will add this feature in the future."

291,291,Any ideas/suggestions o how to make prompts like this more photorealistic?,,midjourney,7.0,19aj0jr,t3_19aj0jr,19aj0jr,"What's the prompt?, **Aphrodite, human like, busty and tall, mythological beauty, piercing and fiery shiny blue eyes standing on a mountain top contemplating the sea world, incredible resolution and fine details, shot on Hasselblad 500C --s 750 --v 5.2**, Start the prompt with:

*Full color photograph.*

Then your description.

Start with Chaos, Weird, and Stylize all zeroed, so you can tweak the language of your prompt before mixing things back up.

MJ also doesn't need all the superfluous language. Try running your prompts through /shorten and see what it calls out for the tokens.

There is also a limited number of tokens available, and MJ reads things in order, so you are likely burning through the tokens before you get to the ""Incredible resolution, Hasselblad"" stuff. I also think it's fairly silly how everyone throws a bunch of photography jargon in, like they would be able to pick a photo taken with that camera, film, or ISO, or by a specific photographer, out of a lineup.

So to recap, by putting the photo part up front, it starts with that as the most important part. Also, if you want to make it look aged or weathered, add Relic or Vintage to the photo part. 

And stop adding a bunch of technical details to the end of your prompt, unless you actually know what you're asking for., [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/rYULIN0) what happens when you just move the photo part up front. It's a pretty basic image, but a good starting point.

This is the reworked prompt:

It is probably something that makes the mass of images tagged with Kongo distinct from other places. It also seems to be something tourists try to see there. So I imagine it is in fact a predominant concept for images that are tagged with Kongo.


The color theme borrows from the national flag.


Googling Kongo attire explains the dress of the Gorilla.


Midjourney just puts together the most distinct associations in the training data.


What imagery did you expect?, I’m not an AI literate person. So the technical reasoning is beyond me. But the relational reasoning that the AI is using seems pretty direct:

- Gorillas and chimps are associated with the African continent and jungles. 
- Lurid, complex patterns in clothing are often associated with African styles. Particularly the Sapeurs from the Congo.
- Spelling Congo with a K also creates an association with Kong, who is a gorilla.

So its taking “Kongo”, and associating it with Africa. Then from Africa its getting apes, King Kong and African clothing styles. 

From all of that, it then produces a series of gorilla/chimp hybrids covered in patterns that would fit reasonably well with certain African styles. The beads and headdress on bottom left are a nod to African jewellery. And I’d guess the bottom right has a suit due to the prevalence of images of Sapeurs from Congo; who love a good suit., Maybe it's trying to mesh Koko and the Congo..."

It's supposed to be an oil on canvas style, before upscaling it's noisy and gritty which it's supposed to be, the details look much closer to a painting you would see in real life before upscaling, just too pixelated from low res., Upscaling involves adding pixels. Any upscaler has to make a decision as to what to do with those new pixels. That's why v6 has a choice of two different upscalers (and back in v4 days there were even more). MJ's upscalers are AIs too, and they're making decisions based on their training about what to do with all the new pixels.

If you use a third-party AI upscaler like Topaz, you'll have MANY settings you can adjust to control the result. (Also you can upscale to any arbitrary size.) But if you want the same pixels, just bigger, just upscale it without AI, in an image editor."

Use the same prompt and different (very different) parameters, Tricky to answer this because they all behave differently in different MJ versions ;)

Stylize though basically controls how strongly MJ tries to apply its default aesthetics. High stylize values will tend to be more ""fancy"" with a lot more detail. For simple images, you want a low value. And you also want a low value if you want to break free of MJ's default style in favor of a different one that you're prompting for.

I can't explain exactly what ""weird"" does, but in my experience... it basically takes the AI off the beaten path, so it will start combining things that don't normally go together, and it will also choose random styles for your image. But I have to say, I find ""weird"" produces much LESS weird stuff in v6 than it did in v5.2, to the point that I'm not sure why it's still called ""weird"" ;)

The official descriptions and examples for all the parameters are here: [https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/parameter-list](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/parameter-list), I did, it looks like I get more accurate stuff if I do stylized than when I use raw with a low seed

However, you were banned for repeated warnings to not produce content that violates our terms of service.  You continued to produce the content you were warned about multiple times and it led to your permanent ban., Yeah what’s up with all the emojis, Left mid journey a while ago.

It really doesn't matter what the image is. They're filling a slot in their template. I don't see how there's any problem with using AI for this.

Those aren't super precise tools either, but they do give you some control over where the subject is relative to the edges of the image.

And then of course there's photoshop...

But if these options don't meet  your needs, AI is probably not ready for your application yet., Yes, sorry - its not the actual crop of the image itself - its more where you place the camera.

Why does it always please me 
When she crawls across the floor
My rivals try to shame me
Marching faster than before

Blood is pooling in my boots
They will never see me cry
The boys are laughing in the trench
To shame me as they die

When I look into the mirror
Now all that's left is skin
Today I made my daddy proud
I march in the boots that he died in

I meet her eyes and ask again 
Why the fuck you always crying 
A window with a little boy
The watcher sees him dying

I use her to be reassured
That all we are is sin
Yet in the mirror of her eye
I am pure humiliation

Who teaches all the girls to crawl
So young across the killing floor
And when daddy laid in mamma's arms
Could she hear him at the door

The mirror cried today inside
When I was looking in
Today I made my daddy proud
I'm alive in the boots that he died in

411,411,Why is MidJourney so bad at understanding what I want?,"I've had a ""Basic"" MidJourney subscription for months now. The only reason I subscribed is because I'm trying to create about 10 images that need to serve as illustrations for a narrated video. After all these months and after creating hundreds and hundreds of images, I only have finished 5 images so far. And even so, I had to use PhotoShop to edit out weird things that no matter how I prompted, couldn't get rid of. Stuff like the usual crazy hands. But also cars with 5 or more wheels (some of which were floating in mid air), horses that had a carriage as hind legs. Stuff like that.

It's even so bad that this month, I used up all my hours on a single image in a single day. And I still don't have an image that I can use.

Today I wanted to use MidJourney to create an image for a blog post. The prompt was simple:

*A man sleeping in a chair, his head tilted back and his mouth wide open. In front of him a tv. On the tv is a cat wearing a tutu, dancing*

This was the image I got:

&#x200B;

It has a tv with a cat. And there's a chair. No idea what else is going on in that picture or why MidJourney thinks that's even close to what I want. I tried a few more times but it didn't get any better:

Why is Baghwan Rajneesh in this picture? I checked my prompt again, seeing if perhaps I accidentally added ""**as seen when on acid**"". I didn't. After a few more tries (and after things got progressively worse) I gave up. I went to Bing Image Creator and entered the same prompt. This is the ***first*** image I got:

This was exactly what I wanted. No weirdness. Just exactly what I asked for. If Bing Image Creator could do other aspect ratios, I would drop MidJourney in a heartbeat. But the thing is, I need my image to be in a 16:9 aspect ratio. And that's why (for now) I'm stuck with MidJourney...",midjourney,3.0,199vz8c,t3_199vz8c,199vz8c,"What version are you using?

",midjourney,1.0,199rieb,t3_199rieb,199rieb,"LOL -- I remember that post. It was a guy who wanted orange and teal in his image. MJ was in a phase where it loved to use those two colors. He got lucky and overinterpreted the result. See my comment in that thread :p

It's never been the case that hex codes worked. MJ was trained on images with their text descriptions. Which almost never include hex codes. There's no way it could have learned to interpret hex codes using that method.

I've seen the devs mention that they're contemplating adding that ability, which they could of course do by introducing a lot of specially tagged training data, I guess.

It seems complicated to me though, because... say you have a colored sphere, like a red croquet ball. In a 2D photo of that sphere, practically every pixel is going to be a different color, due to the differing ways the light interacts with the paint. In a 3D render of the sphere, same thing... in this case, each pixel is colored by a ray tracing algorithm that takes into account light sources. 

In other words, a human virtually NEVER actually sees anything in the real world that is only one color. We just abstract away from the color gradients we perceive, and the brain decides what color it ""really"" is.

So, in a 2D image of a 3D object, which pixels exactly are MJ supposed to color using the hex value you provided? ... Of course, if this would only be used in flat styles like vector graphics and logos, that problem goes away, but that's a minority of the images people generate with MJ.

There may be a real answer to this, heh. In which case please enlighten me ;)"

Kirlian Photography: Captures the electrical coronal discharges around objects, often interpreted as ‘auras’.

Aura Photography: Claims to capture the energy field or aura of a person using specialized equipment.

Photogram: An image created without a camera by placing objects on light-sensitive material and exposing it to light, resulting in a negative shadow image.

Luminogram: Similar to a photogram, but created by moving light sources over light-sensitive paper in a darkroom.

Schlieren Photography: Visualizes fluid flows of varying density, often used in scientific studies. Requires additional direction to achieve the desired effect.

High-speed Photography: Captures fast-moving objects or events, often too quick for the naked eye to see.

Thermography: Infrared imaging technique that captures the heat emitted from objects.

Holography: Creates three-dimensional images using laser lights.

Cymatics: Visual representation of the vibration of sound on physical media. This one is particularly tricky and requires additional direction to have the desired impact. 

Light Painting: A photographic technique involving long exposure shots where a hand-held light source is moved to illuminate a subject or to create patterns.",midjourney,14.0,199jabc,t3_199jabc,199jabc,

I’m a trans woman who is planning for FFS (facial feminization surgery) this year, and have been thinking deeply about what my goals are. I work with AI-based tools for my day job, and it recently occurred to me that I could use these same tools to visualize a potential future me, post surgery. A trusted friend and I decided to see what we could come up with.

Personally speaking, my goal has always been to blend what I love about both masculinity and femininity. Though I love being labeled and thought of as a woman, I feel my gender is closer to the descriptor of “demiwoman” or “bi-gender”. I still have a strong connection to my masculine side, and my previously lived life as a “man”. I often feel both masculine/feminine simultaneously, and I ALSO often feel aligned to no gender whatsoever. My goals for surgery are to embody a blend of masculine and feminine features, with an emphasis on the feminine side. Thus the renders you see before you.

**I’m posting this not only to share my findings, but also to ask: are there any trans folks here who have tried generating these “after” images? If so, what were your goals? Your results? What tools did you use? Are there any cis folks here who are simply curious as to what they may look like as another gender?**

**Do you think AI could be a useful tool for helping people like me realize their full true self?**

There are all sorts of benefits and pitfalls with any new technology, and AI is no different. My goal with this post is to not only share my findings, but also maybe stimulate a thoughtful discussion on the intersection between trans (and gender in general) identities and technology.

Love y’all. I hope you’re safe and well.  🖖🏾

What I basically did was use the prompt below, picked an image I liked, ""upscaled"" it via the U# button, then alternated running Subtle and Strong remixes on the results, over and over again, with the Chaos & Weird parameters completely cranked the opposite direction.

So my starter image will have the Chaos and Weird parameters *--c 0 --weird 0*

I run a Vary (Subtle) remix, but change the the --c and --weird parameters to the maximum value *--c 100 --weird 3000*.

Then I pick the image(s) I like from that new grid.

The new image will have the C&D parameters -*-c 100 --weird 3000*.

I then run a Vary (Strong) remix, but change the C&D to the minimum value of *--c 0 --weird 0*

And then I repeat this over and over again, back and forth, forever, until things get weird.

I guess you could spend a lot of time on that and bias it towards your own style of image ;)

Seriously though, if you want people to see your images, wouldn't you join some kind of community of like-minded people and share with them? :)

Best solution for now is to google ""character consistency in Midjourney"". There are a lot of guides... all of them will tell you it's hard and results aren't guaranteed.

However, somebody said in here that the devs will have something official to support character consistency ""before the end of January"" :O No guarantees but I do know the team realizes its something people want so I have no doubt they've been working on it."

There is a method that might give you what you want -- it's inconsistent, though.

1. Generate an image of the silhouette. Should be a simple, high-contrast image.
2. Make sure ""remix"" is turned on in /settings.
3. Do ""Vary Subtle"" on the image in 1. Change the ENTIRE prompt to describe the landscape.

You should get an image of the landscape with the silhouette is kinda peeking through... or maybe not. Worth a try though! I've had both successes and failures, but I almost always get something more interesting than the source images alone ;)"
533,533,"Love to dream with MJ. Made this frog for the lore book of my world. It’s really fit to the text, just look at this Frogger","Skilled frog scouts observe the situation or target, immersing themselves in a state called ""Duum-voar,"" which means ""Gaze."" It's a meditative practice that allows them to ""detach the body"" and immerse in contemplation, becoming a sensory extension of reality.

Experienced scouts expedite the process using herbal mixtures, such as ""Quiet Swamp"" or ""Misty Forest."" The herbs also enhance their sense of smell and sensitivity to vibrations.

Becoming motionless and holding their breath, the frog gradually changes color, adopting the palette of the surroundings and blending in.

Having reached the limit of Duum-voar, the frog immerses into ""Kuumbra"" – a world of signals, full of the tremors of earth, water, and air. Placed amidst these coordinates, the frog continuously reads reality, where every newcomer and stranger ""sounds"" deafeningly loud.

Thus, every intelligent species knows that it is impossible to pass through the frog domains unnoticed.

Some frogs, familiar with hydromancy, can even raise a veil of thick fog, through which they sense every enshrouded being - its shape, skin and fur, lung capacity, weapons and armor, open wounds, etc. All this information is transmitted further, using low frequencies that cover great distances and penetrate dense vegetation.

534,534,Is it possible to get very specific results?,"I just bought MidJourney today so I’m still trying to figure it out.

I’m talking specific hairstyle, eyes, facial features, clothes, colors, etc… But i’m noticing that after a certain amount of prompts MJ starts to pick and choose only a few. Is there a way to get these hyper specific results or should I just cut my losses and say “close enough” ?",midjourney,2.0,19927fv,t3_19927fv,19927fv,"It’s pretty good about this for most features and clothes, as long as you’re just doing single characters. Feel free to share an sample prompt of what you’re trying, but in general, my advice is use v6, describe the characters using natural language, but short, direct sentences without pronouns. Save outputs that get some of the features right and then put those back in as image prompts, or remix them. You kinda need to learn what, about a particular character, is hard for MJ, and then focus on those, and then do the easy features after., V6 can handle such specific details very well. It's a matter of a few weeks before it becomes available to everyone., I'd add that your prompt should definitely be short and direct, but it does not have to be in sentences ;) v6 is better at some grammatical relations than earlier versions, but it still doesn't handle most grammatical relations well (like subject and object and so on). Don't get fancy with the syntax, and focus on words that have a direct visual interpretation.

Definitely agree that the best approach is to start short and simple, and then keep adding detail one step at a time., ? V6 is available to everyone right now."

Unlike the last poster I made for HL1 this one is more accurate to the in-game characters. Oh and this ones a feature film not a Netflix series 😉

I’ve attached some before and afters and some progression pics so you get an idea of how it was all put together. The hardest part about this was getting Gordons HEV. I was spending so long and still couldn’t get it! so ended up with an alternate version which is the one below. It’s not accurate I know but hey, it’s a movie adaption. DOG was also very hard as there was not much source material to draw from, but I had to include dog 😊

I also had another version of Alyx, & Father Grigori but at the end of the day I’m no casting agent so just went with which one looked more like the original game. I included the other Alyx Version as a poster, not sure which one looks better I kinda like them both.

All the other characters/elements were taken straight from in-game screen shots and converted into somewhat real looking actors using several AI progams in conjunction with one another. ( See other images )  

I also made a few variations with the characters been exclusive in their own poster as a marketing campaign to accompany the main poster. And a bonus I did another Ravenholm one… well because Ravenholm is cool.

I did edit and upscale some original artists work which ill credit below:

sthone - Headcrab Pod

TheGrandestMoff - White combine Soldier

Mapper720 - Combine Gunship

SpitFire\_1988 - City Scanners

Every other individual element was either from the original game or generated with AI and edited/upscaled, even the white radiator was AI generated lol. Actually the only thing that was from google was the gravity gun. But I’m not sure who made that.

I’ll tempted to make a HL3 one now loosely based on Marc Laidlaw’s storyline leak, maybe it might inspire someone to actually make it lol. Anyone hope you like it, I had a lot of fun making it 😊

Here is a high rez version of the poster. You will have to physically highlight it and copy/paste, reddit doesn’t like clickable links for some reason - [https://i.ibb.co/pjRB0BK/HALF-LIFE-2-POSTER-15.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/pjrb0bk/half-life-2-poster-15.jpg), This is so awesome., Who is the guy on the bottom left?

You could also try using a lower --stylize value... since that's what controls how many ""artistic details"" MJ adds.

For a very consistent style, you could also try reverting to version 5.2 and trying the style tuner... that will give you a style code you can use in all your images. Best way to control style in multiple prompts. [https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/style-tuner-1](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/style-tuner-1) (Not available in v6 yet.), I'll give that a try.

I have been running a page for a while where I  upload Midjourney generated imagaes. The thing is I see other AI pages like that of  ""jonaspeterson\_ai on IG and his uploaded posts are of high quality. It's just pleasing on the eyes. I tried using some free upscaling tools. upscaled it 4x( i mostly have been using V6) but it still does not match that of other quality AI pages on Instagram. What am I not doing right?",midjourney,0.0,198o7of,t3_198o7of,198o7of,"Topaz ai. Very good. Its not free, but recommended if you want clarity., I'm not an instagram user (believe it or not), but ... what is the largest image size you can post there? In pixels?

I'm finding the following:

>Instagram posts can be square, landscape, or vertical. All images will be cropped to a square in the feed.  
>  
>The ideal size for square posts is 1080px by 1080px at a 1:1 aspect ratio.  
>  
>For landscape posts, use an image that is 1080px by 566px, with an aspect ratio of 1.91:1.  
>  
>Vertical images should be sized at 1080px by 1350px with a 4:5 aspect ratio.

That is barely bigger than MJ's default size with no upscaling.

Anyway, Instagram or not... there's no point upscaling past what can be displayed on whatever device your image is going to be viewed on. It will just be downscaled again for display, and that results in a loss of quality too. I'd be shocked if many people have monitors that can even do justice to a MJ 4x image. Upscaling does not increase ""quality"" if the extra pixels can't be displayed., Thank you for recommendation. Looks great but it is expensive. I am also looking into Magnific AI., The highest pixel for photo is 1080 I think. If you just check the name that I mentioned on my post above then you will see some of his works(don't think you need IG to see some glimpses of it). It's mainly the clarity of the image. Like I mentioned, it looks very pleasing on the eye. Upscaling tools does help defining the image for instagram. I tried but I am not getting those results. So, just wondering how some people are being able to do it., What upscaling does is add pixels to increase the image size. AI upscales do this intelligently, adding detail and/or definition; conventional upscales just stretch things and sometimes create artifacts or blur.

But like I said, if you upscale and then display on a device that has lower resolution than your image size, you're adding pixels and then the browser or app is removing pixels. And the downscale process is probably not being done intelligently (applications that reduce the display size of images are definitely not currently AI-driven). You can see this happening if you compare an MJ image as displayed by Discord (which does NOT show you the full resolution) with the full-size downloaded .png version; Discord downscales and compresses.

I have no doubt that some Instagram images are more appealing (sharp, detailed etc) than others, but I don't see how upscaling past what IG displays can be responsible for that.

So I'm curious -- why do you think that person whose work you like is achieving what they do by upscaling, as opposed to just creating a good image at the display resolution? And possibly using photoshop filters, which could mimic the effects that Topaz for instance uses in upscales without changing the image size?

Creating an image at display size is the ONLY way the artist can have full control over the image characteristics."

When I commission an artist it's not created by me. Same with AI. I just tell it what I want. And the discussion of what's art and what's not art is as long as art itself (and everchanging as well). There are already good comments here making a good point about why it's not art.

I never understood why this is such a touchy subject by our community (not just MJ, but Generative AI in general). Why are ppl so hellbent on calling it 'art they created'? It's just a fun tool, that has useful applications as well.,  “good artists borrow, great artists steal.” Icasso , It is so cringe that you posted this thinking that they were wrong., Kinda an impossible task here, love, it's a perfectly valid criticism.

652,652,Possible to get source attribution from Midjourney for an image it created?,"Is there anyway possible to know the source material Midjourney used to create the image I used?  The reason I am asking, is to understand if the model used copywritten material to generate an image it created for me (not necessarily worried about personal liability, just wondering).

I actually think it is NOT possible to get this info, but I am not sure.  My guess is that the foundation model is a black box.",midjourney,0.0,198dnmv,t3_198dnmv,198dnmv,"It’s not possible. They keep that stuff to themselves. Probably for liability reasons also. They probably want to minimize people being able to point out which images were used to generate something else., You're right, not possible. Midjourney is an artificial neural network, and these systems are famed for their opacity, including to their creators.

I would go further though and suggest that it's not even a meaningful question. In one sense EVERYTHING MJ has seen goes into the network as a whole, and the structure of the whole thing goes into the output. It's not a set of separate components.

Like a brain, which is exactly the point ;) If YOU paint a picture and I ask you what specific aesthetic experiences you derived it from? Unless you're a copyist or forger, you probably couldn't answer that exhaustively, although you might cite a couple of salient influences., This is totally what I think as well, thanks for confirming....I actually am not sure if they even *could* provide attribution...if they even know or could have the technology to provide that info.  


Training data they know - but I am not sure if they could map an image to the source data technologically., They don't know., Great points, and it makes sense.  I realize we don't actually know exactly how these systems actually derive their output (at least Sam A has said that a few times), so knowing exact attribution would be hard."

Is THAT a meta-loop?, I've also been wondering what will happen when 50% or more of the images on the internet are generated by AI. At that point, it will be much harder for AI models to ""know"" what is correct and incorrect visually since most AI images contain obvious ""errors"" if you examine them closely. It seems to me like the overall quality will go down. Or alternatively, we will simply lower our tolerance for what ""good"" even means since we will be so accustomed to generating images instead of hiring photographers."

675,675,V6 - lack of facial diversity?,"I’ve seen complaints elsewhere that v6 is “overtrained” and I’m curious to see what others think. Compared to 5.2, there’s definitely way less variation. Even using raw/lower stylize values, images seem to default to “v6 face”. For women, that’s a ski-slope nose, freckles, pouty lips - current beauty ideals. New Yorker has a great article titled “Age of The Instagram Face” ([link](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/decade-in-review/the-age-of-instagram-face)) and I’m wondering if this is what’s skewing the training data? I know it’s possible to strip much of this with a zero stylize value, but that’s really limiting for me. I’m not looking to create camera roll style photos. Although v6 works much better with my prompting style (I’ve always been descriptive, never reeled off keywords) I am considering returning to 5.2. It’s a shame because I love the results I’m getting otherwise, but I’m sick of seeing the same face. It just dulls the excitement for me. Anyone else encountering this issue? Any tips beyond stylize? (I also have raw as default).",midjourney,171.0,198826r,t3_198826r,198826r,"Increase weird a bit. You will get more interesting faces., Maybe... This is nothing like the Midge problem of version 3 (I think that was v3), where it would try to force the same female face on every prompt even when you described a very different face.  It's so comparatively easy in v6 to get almost any type of face you want by describing it. 

It's possible that 'model' is overtuned for a certain face type. I guess for me this is just such a low priority compared to the other things that could still be improved with V6, like how the original release of it was so good at doing traditional art styles, and the current version is so much worse., It's the Instagram fuckface., Midjourney  has a  default style, and it applies it to anything the user doesnt specify, if you only specify girl, or model, it will go to its default, to avoid this you have to get more specific on the details you want and also use the style command to dial the default style down or turn it off completely, Midjourney will try to make things beautiful and this is its version of beautiful., I mean, a cursory look at the front page seems to disprove the point. 

I do remember when v5 first came around that I discovered a large portion of the community hated the idea of having to write descriptive and long prompts and were upset that they could not just write one sentence and get something great back. 

If this remains true, then I am sure a certain sect of the MJ user base who only like to make very short and ""easy"" prompts may be getting the bare minimum back from MJ and MJ in turn is using a default artistic preference."

1 & 3: A luminescent Italian Vogue spread is captured with a 4x5 inch large format field camera, using a Schneider Kreuznach Super-Angulon 90mm f/8 lens for its expansive angle and remarkable depth of field control. The scene is bathed in the glow of continuous tungsten lights softened through gauze diffusers, emulating the gentle caress of dawn light. The model, adorned in an airy, ruffled Giambattista Valli gown, is framed against a weathered renaissance wall, her pose languid and introspective. The film stock used is Kodak Tri-X 320 black and white, chosen for its classic grain structure and dynamic range, accentuating the interplay of light and shadow, and the timeless monochromatic palette --style raw --stylize 210 --ar 4:5 --v 6.0

2: Atmospheric shoot for Italian Vogue, use a Sony A7R IV with a vintage Leica Summilux 50mm f/1.4 lens for its unique rendering and character. The model, swathed in an extravagant Roberto Cavalli dress, is poised amidst the ruins of an old Florentine estate. A combination of hazy sunlight and a discreet LED panel mimics the diffuse lighting of a cloudy day, creating soft shadows and a melancholic ambiance. The digital image is post-processed to emulate the look of Lomography Color Negative 400 film, with its bold colors and high saturation, lending the photograph a nostalgic and romantic feel --style raw --stylize 260 --ar 2:3 --v 6.0, Haha now you mention it - Italian vogue especially is v. old school fashion editorial (read: skinny).

Tried something more complex and got nothing like I wanted it to, can't tell it to create a Mexican city with 4 houses for example, it puts more houses. Do you manage to use midjourney like chat GPT or it is a more straightforward/simple app?

Try this (the result doesn't even looks like an Aztec city)

""Create a Tenochtitlan like the description, The city is divided into four zones, or camps. each camp divided into 20 districts with big houses and each big house is crossed by streets or tlaxilcalli. There are three main streets that crosse the city, each leading to one of the three causeways to the mainland of Tepeyac, Iztapalapa, and Tlacopan, they are wide enough for ten horses. Surrounding the raised causeways are artificial floating gardens with canal waterways and gardens of plants, shrubs, and trees. The big houses are divided by channels used for transportation, with wood bridges""",midjourney,0.0,197m2u1,t3_197m2u1,197m2u1,"It can follow directions, but if it gets one wrong or ignores it, you need to spray it with a bottle of water., Right. MJ is not a Large Language Model (which is what chatGPT is).

LLMs are trained on billions of words of text, so they understand human communication including sentence grammar and discourse structure. And they're designed to interact with humans, so they understand things like questions and commands.

Generative image AIs are trained on millions of images and their captions... which typically are just descriptive keywords or short phrases.

You don't prompt MJ like you're talking to a person.  You don't give high level descriptions. You focus on exactly what you want to SEE in your image, using words which MJ knows how to express visually. Everything else will be ignored.

[https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/prompts-2](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/prompts-2), In this case, the Aztec city, how would you make the prompt?, I wouldn't. Think of it as an art generator, not a diagram maker, blueprint creator, or anything like that.


If you want an Aztec themed door, statue, or vase, it can come up with a range of ideas that might help.


Even with v6, a version only in Alpha, it can only handle about 5 distinct ideas in a prompt. 


It also has a built in style and feel to it, which give it biases in what it does and does not know. If you are curious about It's limits, there is documentation on the website, and discussions about prompt crafting on the discord., I see, thanks for the explanation  :)"

I have a few images I like that Ive created and would love to print in a decent size say 20x20 or even 30x30. I upscaled on MJ and got this image. The size is 2400x1800 so as far as I understand at 300DPI that would be 8x6 for a good print. I tried GigaPixel to upscale but it just basically enlarges the image without much filling in so it looks bad as you see it at 100% (which I imagine its what you would see on a print if you move close to it?). Is it possible somehow to get the great images that MJ creates and do large prints or that's not on the cards yet until MJ renders in high definition at large sizes?

I use different settings for every one I do, since what kind of textures and surfaces it contains make a big difference., I read a few posts about Topaz and Gigapixel and tried out the two and came to the conclusion that Gigapixel was better value and product for digital renders, seems topaz is better for photos? I tried it now with Topaz, it fixes the sky and sun and most of the ground but does pretty badly with the sun rays on the water and the lines of the geometric figure. Would you mind posting the one you  created to compare? I used the graphics setting which did the best job...thanks!"

A bit of human squidginess or one person blinking. That's a Polaroid., Ice cream kid has a finger too many, but overall, these are scarily good., That 1st picture is the absolute most realistic thing I've ever seen AI produce. 

For all intents and purposes it is an actual picture. Nobody would be able to tell the difference.

The uncombed hair on the little black kid..the skin of the older woman....all of that is super familiar to me. 

And the clothes man, the clothes. My aunt wore shit like that, what the kid has on  - I wore shit like that. 

It looks like a totally unplanned moment captured in 1983."
770,770,[Advice] Looking to get into Midjourney. Can someone explain the difference between the $10 tier and the $30 tier?,"Does anyone have any good information on what the difference between the $10 tier and $30 tier is? I mean I see that there's ""limited generations"" on the $10 plan. I read somewhere else that wasn't true. Any advice? I apologize if this has been asked 1000 times. I did a search and couldn't find anything.",midjourney,1.0,197kjnb,t3_197kjnb,197kjnb,"well  of course the 10$ plan has less generations than the 30$ one, the only other difference is that in th 30$ plan you can do ""relaxed mode"" which can take longer than the regular ""fast"" mode but does  not consume your alloted generations limit, the 10$ plan does not have relaxed mode., If you're just playing around and not using it to create 1500 images a month, do the low tier. I've had MJ for almost a year, I use it for work daily, and I've created 1913 images and used only 24.78 hours of GPU time.

I have 15 hours per month and right now half way through the month I have used less than 5 hours and I use this all the time. I used it for almost 6 hours today alone. So unless you are powering through jobs, you should be good with 3.3 hours. Time used is not time spent., Thanks for that clarification! I was wondering what was up with that relaxed mode., [https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/en/plans](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/en/plans)

[https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/fast-relax](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/fast-relax)

And just to clarify on number of generations -- ""basic"" isn't limited based on image count, it's limited based on how much GPU time creating the image consumes on MJ's servers. Which depends on the type of image, but also, the model is always being optimized to run faster, and the servers get upgraded. There's a very old estimate that basic is 200 images, but it's much more than that now. You can get an idea of current speeds here (although this page doesn't support Version 6 yet): [https://status.midjourney.com/](https://status.midjourney.com/)"

Yes. The more photographed a person is, esp. celebrities and major poliitcians, the better result you'll have that a roll in MJ will have learned the 'feel' of them., Im saddened that it’s only truly good at REALLY famous people. For example, it won’t do Sam Neil. Someone who’s pretty famous and has been in many movies but somehow Midjourney can’t even get someone to look remotely like him."

Don’t even look at it. Filter it out of search results. I am very interested in generative AI intellectually, but for real world applications I need strictly genuine photos, You definitely would need to spread them across all major stock platforms - Getty, Shutterstock, iStockphoto. Images that sell the most are what we would consider the most common and basic conceptually.

There's still a need - but there is so much decent content already out there providing tons of competition, AI makes us generate it even faster, as well as those potential buyers so inclined who can now generate their own.

At this stage of the game, unless you're already a respected photographer with some type of stylistic following or a 'look' a brand is after, IMHO for the time involved, it's not worth the effort for the small return with stock imagery., Why is that?, Thanx for the advise, bro, but Getty, Shutterstock and Istock don't accept AI content. Only Freepik and Adobe Stock do, Not OP, but I'd assume it's because using fake images doesn't promote consumer confidence.

For instance, if I am scrolling on Amazon and there are two of the same product, I am far more likely to go with the product featuring real images rather than computer-generated ones"

WOE, THE LOVER'S TUNE
 
I'll meet you on a mountain top

Or at the bottom of the sea

Said the demon to the angel

Quite convincingly

I fear it won't be long

Till' they discover you and me

The time is nigh for us to disappear

Cut the ties and leave all that is here

 
The angel cried I can't do that

I cannot leave my Lord

To run with you

Though passion strikes

Within me like a sword

My place is here among the light

To serve those who believe

Though you will always hold a piece of me

I would not go our love can never be

 
Woe sang the dark and light

Woe sang the day and night

Woe sang the sun and moon

Woe woe the lover's tune
 
I'll have another lager

Said the bowman at the bar

As the demon pulled another pint

He noticed the long scar

'That's there to remind me

Of her each and every day

If I'd only known a fraction of the truth

When I was struck by love back in my youth'

The bowman mumbled in his drink

His eyes were far away

The demon poured another round

Said 'you don't have to pay

I too have felt the sting my friend

A pain that never ends

You cannot keep the object of your heart

Love is best left ended at the start'

 
Woe, sang the dark and light

Woe sang the day and night

Woe sang the sun and moon

Woe woe the lover's tune

 
In Heaven souls were silver

And the Word was always good

The angels gathered there to give each moment all they could

Not a one felt drawn to desire or despair

Still they easily recognized the strain

On the one who longed for something unattained

Not pure enough for Heaven

Not foul enough for Hell

Two lost soul in limbo

With one more sad tale to tale

It matters not to you tonight

The moon will not fall down

Promises paraded in the heat

Now washed away by cold rain in the street

 
Woe sang the dark and light

Woe sang the day and night

Woe sang the sun and moon

Woe woe the lover's tune

 
No angel holds a demon and survives with pristine wings

No demon rises to the light

Where Heaven's choir sings

Beneath the veils of madness

Surely lies the wisest way

And wisdom always recognizes bliss

And gladly would be traded for one kiss

 
Woe sang the dark and light

Woe sang the day and night

Woe sang the sun and moon

Woe woe the lover's tune

 
Woe sang the dark and light

Woe sang the day and night

Woe sang the sun and moon

Woe woe the lover's tune

784,784,Midjourney to facelift my kitchen?,"Hi!

Basically I'm looking for an AI that will me to ""facelift"" my kitchen:

1. Take a picture of my kitchen
2. Edit specific aspects. I.e. texture/color, handles, sink, countertop etc.

So I'm not changing the layout/dimensions of my kitchen, only the aesthetics. I guess this is basically some kind of inpainting? Ideally what I'd like is to be able to collect pictures of kitchens I like from say Pinterest, and apply specific elements such as a color to my own kitchen.

There's many AI apps that will ""redesign"" a picture, usually by selected a theme or style. But generally they are quite generic.",midjourney,1.0,197ibkf,t3_197ibkf,197ibkf,"You cant do that in the current state of generative IA, you can generate kitchens with the characteristics you want to see how they would look, but not over a picture of your own kitchen, your best bets would be photoshop or a 3d design software like blender, but you need knowledge  to do  that, you can also ask a designer to do it for you, on IA id say it would be possible around the end of 2024 or somewhere 2025, MJ won't look at a photo of your kitchen and keep some characteristics that you specify the same, and change others.

There are tons of 3D room design software websites available out there specifically for this, and I am pretty sure that some of them use AI. (You want 3D room design as opposed to flat image editors if you want to be able to look at the room from different angles.) Check Google -- this was the first result I got: [https://planner5d.com/use/ai-room-design](https://planner5d.com/use/ai-room-design), If you go on r/photoshoprequests you can ask exactly what you want and skilled ps people will do it for you, you have to pay them to remove the watermark but a lot of them are good, There are already apps that do this. Not general purpose 3D, but room design, absolutely."

I tried to create a style using /tune referencing the URLs of my chosen design, but the styles were always just a little off. Then I started using the seed to create other brand graphics and have gotten decent results.

I thought that I might be able to create a style using the seed in the /tune command, but got an error. It would be nice to use the Sticky Style setting instead of having to put the seed every time. I also feel like a style would give a little more variation in my results, as where using the seed produces results with little variation.

Any pointers, commands, parameters that I should be aware of here?

Try adding a description of pants or shoes to the prompt, You can give more details about bottom part, like what kind of pants they wearing or shoes.

896,896,Remembering the 1993 Eruption of Mount Rainier,,midjourney,509.0,196veu2,t3_196veu2,196veu2,"Whelp, there goes reality...

I pity future historians.

Hang on, what if midjourney isn't just *generating* images, but its opening a quantum portal to alternative timelines?..., I literally had to google “when was mount rainier’s last eruption” .. this is insanely realistic. Truly incredible, **THIS IS AN ALTERNATE HISTORY EVENT. THESE IMAGES ARE AI GENERATED**  
  
Beginning in August of 1992, an increase in activity at Mount Rainier drew the attention of geologists and volcanologists. Numerous studies were being carried out to determine if this increase in activity was indicative of a potential upcoming eruption. The USGS issued a yellow alert for the volcano that lasted throughout the rest of the summer and into the fall. Despite a relatively calm period throughout the fall of 1992, activity began to ramp up in December of 1992. Uplift was being detected around the caldera, as well as an increase in small earthquakes. This prompted the USGS to issue an elevated alert for the volcano, and state officials closed the Mount Rainier National Park. Locals in small towns around the volcano, and particularly those in the high-risk areas for lahars, were notified of the potential for a prompt evacuation should an eruption be determined to be imminent. On January 29th, 1993, a strong magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit the area north of Longmire, Washington, causing noticeable damage to the towns of Eatonville and Packwood. This was soon followed by a massive increase in small earthquakes near and at the volcano. The volcanic alert was increased to imminent and evacuation orders were issued for towns around the volcano, and downstream from the rivers and creeks coming from the volcano. Orders were issued as far as Tacoma, Washington, due to the heavy snowpack on the volcano, and the large lahars that could impact the area. Washington National Guard units were deployed to assist in the evacuation of the nearby towns in what quickly became the largest evacuation in Washington State history. Over 60,000 people were evacuated out of the lahar hazard area.   
  
A small eruption occurred on the morning of February 5th, with activity soon subsiding. Despite the brief pause, activity soon resumed and quickly intensified. At 12:15pm on February 6th, Mount Rainier erupted. Unfortunately, as a direct result of the eruption, 46 people died with a further 78 being injured, including a team from the USGS and a group of National Guardsmen that were caught too close to the volcano. Lahars and mudflows soon began to run down the creeks and rivers, with the Puyallup River swelling to four times its size. Damage to multiple towns in the lahar area has severe, particularly in Ashford, Orting, Greenwater, and Puyallup, Washington. Tacoma also saw significant damage, with Commencement Bay and the Tacoma harbor being blocked by debris and fallen trees. Ash was blown towards the southeast of Rainier, with ash being recorded as far away as Yakima, Washington.   
  
The eruption lasted until the early morning of February 7th, with small outbursts continuing for the next few weeks. A total of 712 people died as a result of the lahars, many having ignored evacuation orders, or strayed too close to the rivers and creeks. Over 20,000 homes and structures were completely destroyed from the floods and lahars, with tens of thousands more being damaged. Parts of I-5 were damaged as well, with many of the roads and bridges closer to Mount Rainier being damaged or destroyed, resulting in a difficulty in reaching areas closer to the Cascades. Recently inaugurated President Bill Clinton toured the area in the weeks following the eruption, pledging full support for the victims and the State of Washington. The eruption was a major turning point in volcanology and disaster preparedness for the Pacific Northwest, with many lessons being learned regarding disaster preparedness and disaster response. These lessons will come into play to a lesser degree following the 1994 Northridge Earthquake in California. Mount Rainier National Park still bares the scars from this event, with many segments of cleared forests still being seen to this day., This is so good! I would be interested in if countries can use systems like this to tell alternate histories and fabricate history. 

These type of images can also be used by political parties to conjure up some disturbing emotions. 

I can imagine this stuff will become a powerful tool for political parties to more effectively rally support since these images look real., This was really freaking cool. Please make more stories like this if you are into history like that"

thank you",midjourney,1.0,196sekg,t3_196sekg,196sekg,"It recognizes a limited range, yes, obviously. It's trained on a finite dataset, which was collected at some point in the past (so never completely up to date). Plus, in order to ""learn"" a style, it has to see enough properly labeled images to form a concept. Plus, if the artist has used a lot of DIFFERENT styles over their career (almost all of them evolve), then MJ's concept of that style might differ from how YOU think of it.

Having said that... v6 with default settings is particularly bad at reproducing art styles because its own particular style tends to override them. You can counteract this by using --style raw and a low --stylize value (like 50). Or try version 5.2.

You can also experiment with the settings of other ""aesthetic"" parameters, like --weird and --chaos. And you can always try using an example image in an image prompt."

I don’t imagine DC would go after them for that., If an ai creates copyrighted material and you use it you are the one that's legally in trouble. The law does not care how you make it.

What I would expect to happen is somebody who has been sued for copyright violation will in turn sue open AI for creating a defective product., How exactly am I using it? If I made a comic book series using these images and sold them then yeah, otherwise whatever. I doubt you’re an expert on copyright law and I know I’m not, so this conversation kinda lacks a bit of substance on both sides making it a little pointless."

1970's dark fantasy map hand drawn paper art dungeons and dragons style, northern region with Fjords and large mountain ranges black metal --v 6

1970's dark fantasy map hand drawn paper art dungeons and dragons style, northern region with Fjords and large mountain ranges, Hey what was yer prompt? I always struggle with actual maps, even if I use like topographic or political with it. It always gives me like a view from like 100,000 ft lol showing the curvature of the Earth.

Edit: i see you were writing your prompts out, lol my bad for being impatient.  Thanks!, So just mountains then lol, As a DnD DM, an absolute map addict and a total nerd, I love this!, Not enough people on this sub share the prompts"

Divination auspicious as an oil painting on canvas in the style of Piero Della Francesca, muted colors, , detailed figures, chiaroscuro, religious theme, on a smooth surface –v 5.2 –ar 3:2

Piero Della Francesca  
Wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piero\_della\_Francesca  
Version 5.2 used. The Zoom tools and vary region tool required to fix details especially the hands. Version 6 can still have problems in rendering hands and feet.  
Version 6 often veers into producing strange images which can still be artistic bit different from the artist.  
The prompt specifies an oil painting on canvas. Thos is to create a smoother image otherwise the images are imposed on a cracked wall. Della Francesca did use oil painting but some of his most renowned work was with egg tempera. Mention this in a prompt and an egg will often appear.

But there is a method that MIGHT work in MJ... where you generate an image and then, using vary/remix, replace it with a completely different prompt. That will overlay the characteristics of one image on another one. Haven't tried this with text though.

Edit: OK, yeah it works kind of :) I managed to get the word ""peace"" showing up vague but legible as light on gray clouds, as follows:

1. Generate ""the word ""peace"" in white type on black --style raw --s 50 --v 6.0""
2. Vary Subtle with remix, replace the prompt text with ""cloudy sky"".

Will take some experimenting to get really good results, and I'm sure it won't work for every case but there's some potential! Vary Region MIGHT work for this too, once it's available for v6."

Something like:

Pancake with butter and translucent syrup lettering two words “Happy Holidays” in golden brown syrup lettering…… dimensional lettering, perfect details, perfect typography, perfect spelling… 

- tell it the number of words explicitly 
- words in quotes
- describe the type of ink/letting you want in detail
- use these terms to “tell” MJv6 to focus on drawing good text: perfect details, perfect typography, perfect spelling, (if numbers) perfect numbers, precise details
- describe the typography (ie what baseline, script/block, serif/sans serif etc for better font

Think about it like you’re telling MJ how to “draw” typography, rather than “writing” and it works well. Still jumbles sometimes, but the success rate is way better, excellent advice, thank you so much!"

33,33,New frog with simple animation,"
""My friend"" — this is how frogs, dedicated to geomancy, call their subordinate stone, or Amlyrunt.

The stone is summoned in late summer. A neophyte asks for the ""earth to give birth to a friend,"" because the ""blood is so cold"" and the ""Sun is fickle.""

Amlyrunt is born from the torn flesh of the earth, bursting through darkness and roots, often dragging along bones of past creatures and times, which play a special role in rituals.

Carefully, the stone is cleaned from the earth and placed on a cushion of moss. Then its name is read from the relief, which helps in its awakening.

For this, the frog moistens a coniferous paw with its own blood, then sprinkles Amlyrunt and calls to it, time after time. The stone ""listens"" to the call, increasingly covered with droplets that flow and fill grooves and pits, leaving crimson streaks.

Finally, at the next wave, hearing its name again, the stone comes to life, and fresh droplets hiss and boil on it. A tide of light, warmth, and the intoxication of burnt blood descends on the requester.

Of course, Amlyrunt is a terrifying weapon. A flying fiery hammer, capable of tirelessly crushing the bodies of enemies, on whom their clothing catches fire from its heat. But frogs are peaceful and value it primarily for its ability to give off heat, slowly disintegrating.

Over time, the stone friend ""is honed"" into a spherical shape. It is believed that from this moment it is perfect. Upon disintegration, heated particles flow upward and extinguish. If necessary, the mage controls the disintegration, rubbing a pinch of earth that gradually becomes filled with light and warmth.

The stone can warm the earth and make it pliable for digging a cache or a shelter if one needs to wait out in anabiosis for a couple of weeks. It also heats and boils water if you need to make an herbal infusion or cook.

Thanks to the stone friend, even a geomancy neophyte can survive outside heating zones, without the help of symbiotes, settlements, and large ""domes of warmth."" They can move in almost any weather, not afraid of freezing.

This is the reason for their individualism. They are free to move alone, not afraid of ""losing heat."" Travel allows them to look beyond their own kind and think not only within the formula of ""common heart — common warmth.""",midjourney,11.0,19elzlr,t3_19elzlr,19elzlr,

Things I  currently look for include:

* **Hands** \- although they are getting so much better
* **Spelling** \- especially if there is a lot of text, though this *can* be photoshopped later
* **Hair -** wacky hair day is not real
* **Backgrounds** \- being fully blurred, or having architecture issues (misaligned steps, etc)
* **Other Face stuff** \- check teeth, ears, wrinkles, eyes for details

*What other details make it easy to spot ""fake"" images?*

I know there are services that will help identify fakes:

* [https://hivemoderation.com/ai-generated-content-detection](https://hivemoderation.com/ai-generated-content-detection) \- I haven't used this Chrome extension (yet)
* [http://aiornot.com](http://aiornot.com) \- I have used this, and it is great, but I am careful in my usage because I don't want to use up my free usage cap
* ChatGPT - I tried, and it was not reliable, but I think it could be a signal 

*Any other services to help (I know that these are not fully reliable)?*

It was quite a journey,to say the least, to navigate and bounce between ChatGPT, InvideoAI, to Midjouney to Pika, Epidemic Sound to Canva, and of course to Adobe's Firefly, Express, Audition, and Premiere Pro AI tools - this was so much fun!

Shout out to [@curiousrefuge](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClnFtyUEaxQOCd1s5NKYGFA) and the team for their AI Filmmaking Course for giving the challenge. For those wondering if it's worth the fuss, I'm an actual student in this year's January course and I've got my work cut out for me.

Stay tuned and follow-along as we continue sharing our creative journey (and next iterations of this film series).[https://youtu.be/URjiwSOhlj4?si=g-oC8Nu6pKQrAxqW](https://youtu.be/URjiwSOhlj4?si=g-oC8Nu6pKQrAxqW)

Unfortunately, I don't know what this style is called or if it even *has* a name. Is it an art style, like maybe a ""collage""... or is it a technique of some sort? If it *does* have a name, that might help me with the prompts.

I'm trying to produce backgrounds with assorted-sized swirly hearts in various shades of a specific color (I do not want multiple colors in the same background), with soft edges, blended together and randomly positioned on a background of the same color, but in a darker shade.  

These particular backgrounds were created using ""watercolor"" in the prompt, but I've also seen them created using ""oil painting"", ""ink"", ""terracotta"", ""parchment"", ""suede"", ""satin,"" ""glass"", ""bubble"" ""liquid"", ""smoke"", ""monet"", ""impressionist"", etc. I hope to be able to use this variable for different art products, textures, and styles (or even specific artists' styles).

I've tried lots of different prompts, but all of the results suck. Some of the keywords I have used, in every possible combination, include collage, swirls, surreal, psychadelic, liquid, blended, intertwined, interwoven, interlinked, and more. 

One of the prompts I tried was:

>scattered swirly hearts with soft edges, in shades of light blue, watercolor paint style, blended and intertwined together, on a dark blue suede background

Whatever I do, the hearts turn out to be either (a) melded together in a big, indistinguishable lump with no semblance of a heart shape in sight, or (b) completely separate and apart from each other with hard erges, or (c) one big, single heart that's either really cool or really scary.

""People were gone. I was just wasting time searching for them. Everywhere I looked, wherever I found myself, only one thing awaited me. Emptiness. This journey on the yacht was superfluous. Beyond the horizon, there was nothing.""

Robert bowed his head to the water's surface and saw a fin.

Several sharks swam peacefully among the rhythmically swaying ships. The absence of people affected the marine inhabitants. They had become bolder and were no longer afraid of the constant clatter of propellers and darting boats.

After a few moments, the water began to sparkle.

Robert was amazed. He peered into the ocean depths with genuine interest, and what he saw took his breath away.

He saw fluorescent inhabitants of the sea depths, ranging from medium-sized fish to colonies of very small jellyfish.

Usually, such creatures were found at great depths, where light gave way to pitch darkness, but now, for some completely unknown reason, all these creatures were here, at his feet.

Thousands, hundreds of thousands of creatures created an entire universe of bright, varied colors.

The hypnotic dance of various forms of bodies, lured the last man.

He wanted to descend to them, and he was not even frightened by the realization that among the stars of the ocean, predatory shadows lurked, occasionally passing close enough to Robert for him to clearly see the sharp teeth and empty, black eyes.

The man stood up.

The sky above the man's head, filled with the light of billions of suns, collided with the ocean horizon, ignited by life itself.

There was truly cosmic silence.

No wind, no waves, no splashes.

The last doubts left Robert, he took a long, decisive step forward, and in the next moment, he was flying into the water, not closing his eyes, towards life.

Why does it always please me 
When she crawls across the floor
My rivals try to shame me
Marching faster than before

Blood is pooling in my boots
They will never see me cry
The boys are laughing in the trench
To shame me as they die

When I look into the mirror
Now all that's left is skin
Today I made my daddy proud
I march in the boots that he died in

I meet her eyes and ask again 
Why the fuck you always crying 
A window with a little boy
The watcher sees him dying

I use her to be reassured
That all we are is sin
Yet in the mirror of her eye
I am pure humiliation

Who teaches all the girls to crawl
So young across the killing floor
And when daddy laid in mamma's arms
Could she hear him at the door

The mirror cried today inside
When I was looking in
Today I made my daddy proud
I'm alive in the boots that he died in

830,830,Why is MidJourney so bad at understanding what I want?,"I've had a ""Basic"" MidJourney subscription for months now. The only reason I subscribed is because I'm trying to create about 10 images that need to serve as illustrations for a narrated video. After all these months and after creating hundreds and hundreds of images, I only have finished 5 images so far. And even so, I had to use PhotoShop to edit out weird things that no matter how I prompted, couldn't get rid of. Stuff like the usual crazy hands. But also cars with 5 or more wheels (some of which were floating in mid air), horses that had a carriage as hind legs. Stuff like that.

It's even so bad that this month, I used up all my hours on a single image in a single day. And I still don't have an image that I can use.

Today I wanted to use MidJourney to create an image for a blog post. The prompt was simple:

*A man sleeping in a chair, his head tilted back and his mouth wide open. In front of him a tv. On the tv is a cat wearing a tutu, dancing*

This was the image I got:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/biwz1oqzi8dc1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4f4aabe889f8b4cd9dd6e2053f498007e769bd4

It has a tv with a cat. And there's a chair. No idea what else is going on in that picture or why MidJourney thinks that's even close to what I want. I tried a few more times but it didn't get any better:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/on7bgouej8dc1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=df3ca4b98f8211e6eeec978f1bebb69cce5c3292

Why is Baghwan Rajneesh in this picture? I checked my prompt again, seeing if perhaps I accidentally added ""**as seen when on acid**"". I didn't. After a few more tries (and after things got progressively worse) I gave up. I went to Bing Image Creator and entered the same prompt. This is the ***first*** image I got:

https://preview.redd.it/k0leldnri8dc1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19c085860e493b8f666a3fe7bfc2989c3e1c88dd

This was exactly what I wanted. No weirdness. Just exactly what I asked for. If Bing Image Creator could do other aspect ratios, I would drop MidJourney in a heartbeat. But the thing is, I need my image to be in a 16:9 aspect ratio. And that's why (for now) I'm stuck with MidJourney...",midjourney,3.0,199vz8c,t3_199vz8c,199vz8c,

Kirlian Photography: Captures the electrical coronal discharges around objects, often interpreted as ‘auras’.

Aura Photography: Claims to capture the energy field or aura of a person using specialized equipment.

Photogram: An image created without a camera by placing objects on light-sensitive material and exposing it to light, resulting in a negative shadow image.

Luminogram: Similar to a photogram, but created by moving light sources over light-sensitive paper in a darkroom.

Schlieren Photography: Visualizes fluid flows of varying density, often used in scientific studies. Requires additional direction to achieve the desired effect.

High-speed Photography: Captures fast-moving objects or events, often too quick for the naked eye to see.

Thermography: Infrared imaging technique that captures the heat emitted from objects.

Holography: Creates three-dimensional images using laser lights.

Cymatics: Visual representation of the vibration of sound on physical media. This one is particularly tricky and requires additional direction to have the desired impact. 

Light Painting: A photographic technique involving long exposure shots where a hand-held light source is moved to illuminate a subject or to create patterns.",midjourney,13.0,199jabc,t3_199jabc,199jabc,

It’s really fit to the text, just look at this Frogger","Skilled frog scouts observe the situation or target, immersing themselves in a state called ""Duum-voar,"" which means ""Gaze."" It's a meditative practice that allows them to ""detach the body"" and immerse in contemplation, becoming a sensory extension of reality.

Experienced scouts expedite the process using herbal mixtures, such as ""Quiet Swamp"" or ""Misty Forest."" The herbs also enhance their sense of smell and sensitivity to vibrations.

Becoming motionless and holding their breath, the frog gradually changes color, adopting the palette of the surroundings and blending in.

Having reached the limit of Duum-voar, the frog immerses into ""Kuumbra"" – a world of signals, full of the tremors of earth, water, and air. Placed amidst these coordinates, the frog continuously reads reality, where every newcomer and stranger ""sounds"" deafeningly loud.

Thus, every intelligent species knows that it is impossible to pass through the frog domains unnoticed.

Some frogs, familiar with hydromancy, can even raise a veil of thick fog, through which they sense every enshrouded being - its shape, skin and fur, lung capacity, weapons and armor, open wounds, etc. All this information is transmitted further, using low frequencies that cover great distances and penetrate dense vegetation.

I'm looking for tips to organically promote my coloring books.

I am going to develop for you a list of the tools that I have exclusively for this:

- I have an exclusive Pinterest account for my books with 4.3k impressions in the last 30 days: https://www.pinterest.es/coloringemotions

- An Instagram account with 476 followers: @aiartedigital

- I create books in two languages: Spanish and English

- I was able to register a domain in Spanish and start a small website with Wordpress: https://librosparacolorear.net

- I am also part of the Amazon authors section: https://www.amazon.com/author/cesarsanchez

- My personal Twitter account with 6600 followers.

My questions are:

- Could someone help me generate a kind of plan to shape all this?

- What could I do differently to generate a sale?

- Are Amazon ads the real way to achieve this? My plan is not to spend money yet until I have something organized.

I understand that I'm in this for the long haul but any help would be welcome.

""A cartoon drawing of a stick-man alone with his hands in the air with a white background and the word ""Hey"" above him, in the style of the New Yorker cartoons, --v 6.0""

It couldn't get all the words quite right on the first one so I added in my own. Wish V6 had the adjust region option to rework the words. Would have liked to match the drawings better, also more stick-figurey drawings, but it is what it is atm.",midjourney,,19exaco,t3_19exaco,,

I was designing my wedding invite artwork and my iPad was stolen, now I'm in a tough spot","hello all, I designed some artwork for my wedding invites, included in this post (Picture 1) and I was going to create another companion artwork for it- it would basically be the second picture included (Picture 2), but drawn to have a similar looking style and colouring. My iPad was then stolen and I can't afford to replace it and it's getting so close to the wire to have the images ready. I've been trying to use ai to do this but I just can't crack it.
